    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <p>In this tab, no evolutionary process is at work. You can observe your individuals under different conditions, but they will not undergo any changes over time.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Header</h2>
    <h4>Tracks</h4>
    <p>The <strong>Tracks</strong> button allows you to choose a track from your personal list.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Toolbar</h2>
    <h4>Selector</h4>
    <p>The selector allows you to choose between displaying the <strong>Experimental Settings</strong> tab and the <strong>Laboratory</strong> tab.</p>
    <h4>Time Controller</h4>
    <p>
      It displays the playback speed. The double arrows on either side allow you to increase or decrease this speed.
      <br>
      The <strong>Play/Pause</strong> button allows you to start or pause the race.
      <br>
      The <strong>Start Over</strong> button clears all data related to the current process. Some experimental settings are reset.
    </p>
    <h4>Settings</h4>
    <p>The <strong>Minimum</strong> and <strong>Maximum</strong> speed sliders allow you to modify the speed limits of the cars.</p>
    <h4>Add a Car</h4>
    <p>This button allows you to add a new vehicle to the race, choosing its driver from your saved individuals or a human driver.
      <br>
      A view then appears, showing the driver's neural network.
      <br>
      On the left, a button allows you to change the color of the vehicle.
      <br>
      Another button allows you to remove the vehicle from the race.
      <br>
      If you add a human driver, you will be able to drive the car with the arrows on your keyboard (feel free to slow down playback time to help you).
    </p>
    <p class="green_paragraph">If you add or modify the settings of a driver, the experiment will automatically restart.</p>
    <h4>Laboratory</h4>
    <h5>Reproduction:</h5>
    <p class="sub_paragraph">Choose two individuals from your list, then click on the <strong>Reproduce</strong> button: a floating window will ask you to save the individual resulting from the reproduction.</p>
    <h5>Mutation:</h5>
    <p class="sub_paragraph">Choose one individual from your list, then click on the <strong>Mutate</strong> button: a floating window will ask you to save the mutated individual. A slider allows you to adjust the mutation rate.</p>
    <p class="green_paragraph">For more information on reproduction and mutations, refer to the part of the guide on Genetic Algorithm.</p>
