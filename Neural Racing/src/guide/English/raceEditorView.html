    <h2>Header</h2>
    <h4>Manage</h4>
    <p>The <strong>Manage</strong> button allows you to edit an existing track or save a new one. A menu opens, offering four choices:
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Edit a racetrack</strong> offers the possibility to choose the track from those contained in your personal list </li>
            
            <li> <strong>Import a racetrack</strong> allows you to use an external file, shared by a friend for instance. </li>
            
            <li> <strong>Save the racetrack</strong> offers the possibility to add the track to your personal list </li>
            
            <li> <strong>Export the racetrack</strong> allows you to save the file in the directory chosen by the user, for example, for sharing with a friend. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
      
    <p class="green_paragraph">How can I edit an existing track without creating a new one afterward?</p>
    <p>If you save the modified track in your personal list giving it its original name, the new version will simply replace the old one.</p>

    <h2>Toolbar</h2>
    <h4>Selector</h4>
    <p>The selector at the top of the toolbar allows you to choose between a <strong>Tile</strong> mode and a <strong>Surface</strong> mode. 
        <br> The former enables you to place the chosen tile wherever you click, or to paint with the tile if you drag it around. 
        <br> The latter allows you to perform actions on all tiles in an area of the grid that you select. These actions are available at the bottom of the toolbar, only in this mode.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center">

          <br>
          <i>A selection in surface mode.</i>
        </p >

    <h4>Tile Type</h4>
    <p>By clicking on the image of the selected tile, a drop-down menu appears and allows you to choose another one. The user can choose between four types of tiles: <strong>Straight Line</strong>, <strong>Turn</strong>, <strong>Start Line</strong>, and <strong>Grass</strong>.</p>
    <h4>Orientation</h4>
    <p>The user can apply a rotation of 90Â° to the right or to the left to the chosen tile.</p>
    <h4>Tools</h4>
    <p>The buttons at the bottom of the toolbar appear in surface mode.
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Fill</strong> button allows you to replace all tiles in the selected area with the chosen tile.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Copy</strong> button allows you to keep in memory the tiles of the selected area.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Paste</strong> button then allows you to replace the tiles of a selected area with those kept in memory.</li>
                <li>The <strong>Cut</strong> button also performs a copy action, but replaces the copied tiles with grass.</li>
                </p>
            </ul>
    <p class="green_paragraph">What happens if I copy an area of a certain size and then try to paste it into an area of a different size?</p>
    <p>If the paste area is smaller than the copied area, only part of the original tiles will be pasted. In the opposite case, the paste will be done normally, ignoring the excess of the paste area.</p>

    <h2>Main View</h2>
    <h4>In Tile mode</h4>
    <p>The selected tile is placed where the user clicks. If you keep pressing and drag the cursor around, you can paint with the tile.</p>
    <h4>In Surface mode</h4>
    <p>Hold the cursor and move it to <strong>select</strong> an area. You can then use the tools at your disposal to apply actions on the selected area. To <strong>deselect</strong> it, release the cursor and then perform a simple click on the grid.</p>
